      <header>Acceptance</header>
<p>Accept what you can't control. Life is unpredictable. From time to time various challenges will surface, complicating your daily routine and leaving you anxious, drained, or even afraid.
<div></div>
It’s entirely natural to feel worried, dismayed or angried by something. But when you fixate on those feelings, they can eventually take over, disturbing your peace and making it more difficult to cope. Accepting your own thoughts and emotions is an effective strategy.</p>
<p>Practice cognitive reframing by reminding yourself:
<ul>
  <li>What’s happening right now won’t last forever. In the meantime, I’m doing my best.”</li>
  <li>“This is a tough situation, but I can get through it.”</li>
  <li>“I feel miserable right now, but I won’t always feel like this.”</li>
  </ul>
</p>

You + Acceptance= Self Love

<section class="main-section" id="Forgiveness">
  <header>Forgiveness</header> 
      <p>Feeling hurt, even angry, when someone wrongs you or treats you unfairly is an understandable (and completely natural) response.
Yet holding on to grudges or slights won’t do much to help you find inner peace. Nursing feelings of anger or resentment takes up plenty of emotional energy and can contribute to physical and mental health symptoms such as poor heart health, sleep problems, stomach distress, depression, anxiety.</p>
      <p>Forgivness benefits the person you forgive and you even more so. You are on the right path to self-forgiveness if you’ve:
        <ul>
  <li>apologized</li>
  <li>made an effort to amend the wrong</li>
  <li>committed to changing your behavior</li>
  </ul>
      </p>
      <code>
You + Forgiveness= Self Love

      <p>Journaling, talking to a trusted friend/family member, talking to a therapist, expressing yourself through a hobby(making something like a painting) or excercising can provide you with a different perspective. It can help you process and express emotions you might otherwise keep inside.</p>

        <ul>
  <li>Journal</li>
  <li>Talk to a trusted individual</li>
  <li>Excercise or create</li>
  </ul>
